<p id="25ef3237-e4ce-45f2-b89c-18c7fbefb7aa">Despite declining numbers in hunters, the excise tax appropriations from Pittman-Robertson (a key source of conservation funding) rose substantially during the Obama administration. This is most likely explained by a surge in gun sales driven by fear of stricter gun laws. The surge in funding in relation to gun sales would also indicate that many of the taxed purchases funding Pittman-Robertson are more likely to be for non-hunting related reasons (ex: pistol for home defense) vs for hunting activity. In order for conservation to have a more stable funding base, amendments to the Pittman-Robertson Act should seek to broaden and diversify the tax pool by considering a backpack tax.</p>

	<strong>The North American Model of Wildlife Conservation is regarded as one of the world&#x27;s most successful system of policies and laws to restore and safeguard fish and wildlife and their habitats through sound science and active management.</strong></p>
	
	<p id="a5c21789-f58a-421a-affa-88654905b9f2" class="">The model plays a large role in conservation success stories that have created vast expanses of publicly owned land available for all Americans to enjoy and also brought countless species back from the brink of extinction.</p><p id="2b6c157b-eb6f-4502-9507-4426bb2be9dd" class="">A key component of the Model is the Pittman-Robertson Act signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt who said:</p>

   <div class="epigraph">
	<blockquote><p>"A nation that destroys it soils destroys itself. Forest are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people" - FDR </p></blockquote>
</div>

	<p id="2d54d5ac-7a85-44a7-976c-1ca86846458b" class="">The Pittman-Robertson Act created a tax on hunting equipment, such as firearms and ammunition, in what is known as a &#x27;pay-to-play&#x27; approach where the theoretical user of the resource, in this case Hunters, are the ones who pay for the maintenance and stewardship of that resource, in this case wildlife.</p>

  <p id="35cd8706-e52c-41f3-916e-ac993b91e99e" class="">While this approach has been remarkably successfully resulting in $1.1 billion in taxes revenue earmarked for wildlife conservation being distributed in 2018, it is threatened by the demise of the traditional american hunter with a consistent downward trend in the percent of the population who participate.</p>
	
	<p id="a4a3630a-d02e-4d0a-a890-6f128bfe54fa" class="">Oddly though, despite a clear trend of declining numbers in hunters, the excise tax appropriations from Pittman-Robertson have risen substantially over the past few years driven predominantly by a surge in gun sales related to fears around stricter 2nd amendment regulations.</p>

  <p id="0f657ce0-78e7-4644-9057-c9dad32e388b" class="">This rise in tax revenue in contrast to the decline of hunters would point towards weapons purchases vs hunting purchases as a larger portion of the revenue for Pittman-Robertson. For example, the purchase of an AR-15 for self-defense vs the purchase of archery equipment.</p><p id="463fdb38-c4c9-4e8a-a94a-a6129369443e" class="">This relationship between weapon purchases and funding for conservation deserves more consideration as the decline of hunting and unpredictability of firearm sales, regardless of how you feel about both of them in general, make them a weak foundation for the primary source of conservation funding in the United States.</p>

  <p id="0d208bac-f596-4ea5-9100-0ed283c8d777" class="">One potential solution would be to expand the &#x27;pay-to-play&#x27; model by taxing those who enjoy the benefits from it today, such as hikers or birdwatchers who enjoy the use of trails paid for by hunters/gun sales, but in reality don&#x27;t pay for it themselves since things like hiking boots and binoculars are not taxed the same way as hunting equipment.</p><h3 id="6b604871-20a2-45c6-a017-accff7d3d624" class="">Method and Medium</h3>

  <p id="c320d5dd-03bf-4795-85ec-fbb84adcbcb7" class=""><strong>Method: </strong>For the analysis of my data I am using a few available tools. The first and primary tool/method I am relying on is the R programming language as it is a language designed for statistical analysis and has many options around data manipulation(ex: the package dplyr) and data visualization(ex: the package ggplot2). R also has the benefit of there being different &#x27;recipes&#x27; available on how to do certain types of visualizations, which allows mix and match from different &#x27;recipes&#x27; to create new and different visualizations incorporating pieces you liked from the &#x27;recipes&#x27;</p>

  <p id="03286eb2-eca5-44a4-bf1b-2cb0e94dbeeb" class="">I will also use Tableau as one weakness in R that I have encountered is that it is difficult to create graphs utilizing dual-axis, which Tableau fortunately handles with ease.</p>

  <p id="134c8b7a-d382-4058-8209-f306be9ffb17" class="">While relying primarily on R might make the overall project more difficult for me, I feel that gaining more experience in using the tool outweighs the cons as my belief is that R is a better long-term skill to invest in as it is a free and open source tool and in demand skill for employers.</p>

  <p id="1dd64cc1-deda-434c-b42f-4d648bdb23ac" class=""><strong>Medium: </strong>I intend to document my final story as a integrated piece of my portfolio site. This allows me to leverage some of the thoughtful readability elements incorporated into the CSS styling, such as off white background and a off black and a serif font designed for web use. I also personally favor the more minimalist design tendencies advocated by Edward Tufte and feel that the use of his CSS styling helps me to craft my story more in line with best-practices he has developed over the years.</p>

  <p id="83643c63-a4fd-4e65-aced-c3cdcd314a5a" class="">While in choosing this medium I might miss out on some of the swanky features of Shorthand, such as parallax scrolling. Similar to my choice to use R, I feel that the personal learning benefit I gain from focusing on learning more about building a personal website in pure HTML and CSS outweighs the cons of missing out on the more feature laden Shorthand.</p>

  <p id="fc50cf48-87ea-436f-906d-dcbc670f2c93" class="">For example, I will always be able to convert my HTML document into other styling using different CSS style sheets and also will always have ownership and control over the final document vs with Shorthand, they might look to delete any stories I have hosted with them if I do not use it for a long-period of time; this would be sad since I would lose a valuable portfolio example.</p>

  <p id="54ebd7b8-04de-4dd2-af0a-9efc5bfc5fad" class="">In my images I tried to go for some consistency in the muted greens and earth tones ones might feel in the forest and nature. I did not feel I was able to achieve 100% thematic consistency in the tone of the photos, but overall felt the ones that strayed did not do so in a way that was distracting or detracting from the overall product.</p>

More specifically though I am focused on those who already actively partake in enjoying the benefits of nature and want to learn more about conservation funding in order to better define their own position on conservation funding. However, as a primary target audience, I am most interested in individuals who participate in outdoor activities but are neither hunters nor gun enthusiast. </p><p id="f16ff321-eaa4-4a8d-aab7-c6954c71452f" class="">I am most interested in these individuals as they are the ones who would need to be converted to favoring a &#x27;Back Pack&#x27; Tax as a policy position to improve the funding base of Pittman-Robertson. My hope is that by pointing out that something they like (nature and conservation) is funded by something they don&#x27;t like (gun sales), that they might become more open to supporting a tax on other outdoor recreation equipment they might purchase.</p><p id="2bfdabc8-42cb-404c-9cea-0eefb09faac4" class=""><strong>Hunter</strong></p><p id="2a6423bd-51d6-4536-bd98-0454a69229a5" class="">As a <strong>Hunter</strong> I want <strong>to understand my contribution to conservation</strong> so that I can <strong>make informed choices around how I choose to support conservation</strong></p><p id="c576b5ec-0fca-4def-b7ef-c883ca305b98" class=""><strong>Gun Control Advocate</strong></p><p id="fb6d9174-6816-401f-b0be-e7e142f7b01a" class="">As a <strong>Gun Control Advocate</strong> I want <strong>to understand my contribution to conservation</strong> so that I can <strong>make informed choices around how I choose to support conservation</strong></p><p id="428eabb2-1655-4005-8e57-f33993797c14" class=""><strong>Outdoor Enthusiast (Primary Audience)</strong></p><p id="e89bc4b0-8377-490a-a21e-d9ffd7b69ad1" class="">As a <strong>Outdoor Enthusiats</strong> I want <strong>to understand my contribution to conservation</strong> so that I can <strong>make informed choices around how I choose to support conservation</strong></p><h3 id="3fe679dc-7309-410e-a917-ab84c969aea5" class="">User Research Protocol</h3><p id="65a4908c-1308-4b38-8a62-1a2d1dcd4d26" class="">For my user research I have the benefit of living in Portland, OR which has both an odd abundance of hunters and outdoor enthusiast who are pretty extreme in their anti-hunting and anti-gun sentiment. For my users, I used coworkers and friends who fit the general personas I was interested in; I realize that using people who know you is generally not best practice in user research but time was of the essence in the project and most of my users are capable of being brutally honest with me.</p><p id="0687da77-901c-4400-9f9b-2303ca153755" class=""><strong>Script:</strong> I like to generally start very open ended on my user research interactions and let their initial responses then guide the conversation. Below is the my opening question, which I then used as a starting point for telling my story, which I did through oral narrative and showing prototype charts. I Then closed the conversation with the below ending question to determine if I have achieved persuading my audience to fund conservation through additional revenue beyond hunting equipment.</p><ul id="3240e8f3-412f-4f25-92ad-2b9b79827f60" class="bulleted-list"><li><strong>Starting Question: </strong>Where do you believe the majoraty of conservation funding comes from?</li></ul><ul id="59cc36fb-789d-4fe6-b06c-6a9c974cac06" class="bulleted-list"><li><strong>Ending Question: </strong>Would you be open to paying more for conservation?</li></ul><h3 id="7942f2ec-cd5e-454c-ad6e-cedd5ffede75" class="">User Research Findings</h3><p id="4ca1c9ee-9c2b-4acd-b536-96fc7cafb786" class="">Generally, I found the users I interviewed had very little understanding of overall conservation policy and its funding. This was difficult to navigate with users at times because some would get curious about all funding for broad array of different government groups like the national parks service, world wild life foundation, etc. While others, would not care much about the policy and get straight to the WIIFM(Whats In It For Me?) to understand how they might stand to benefits.</p><p id="3d7a88fa-cc3e-451a-973d-796a5decf7bd" class="">Overall though, those who were not hunters, including those who were gun owners, were mostly unaware that a tax on firearms was a significant source of conservation funding with its roots in a tax aimed at hunters.</p><p id="4b805f81-d336-4d60-bb98-3a58c6a3dec0" class="">Once aware of the source of the tax, most of the users who fell into the primary target audience were open to considering paying additional taxes themselves but wanted to learn more about them before following a call to action that committed them to supporting additional taxes on things like equipment sold at REI (kayaks, backpacks, boots).</p><h3 id="fb2e86e6-82fd-4722-a096-4e344c0be626" class="">Final Designs</h3>

<h3 id="dfdbfe22-d1e5-4af1-933f-c8b674dd1cf3" class="">Adaptions for Target Audience</h3>

<p id="b2f945e7-579b-42d8-b4eb-b63cb47fc332" class="">Once I identified a more specific target audience of the outdoor enthusiast who might generally be opposed to firearms, I tried to make a more targeted story to them that highlighted things they enjoy about the outdoors, such as the overall benefits of conservation(ex: like saving species from going extinct), while also showing that much of the funding for these conservation activities that we all benefit from and that they, the user, actively enjoys, comes from something driven by sales spiking after mass shootings.</p>

<p id="ec9bb931-ee93-47bb-a68e-28b0339d0d40" class="">I think this emotional link to the politics and sadness of how gun sales spike after mass shootings and how we can see these sale spikes reflected in the tax revenue generated helped better convert users to being more open to alternative funding sources.</p>

<p id="c7c3ca6b-597e-4096-96fc-3ba0c5bea967" class="">However, I wanted to try and tell the story in a way that was balanced enough that a pro-gun/pro-hunting user might read the end and not feel offended by the portrayal and hope that the others would consider the backpack tax as a way to enlarge the pool of overall spending for conservation.</p>

<p id="39ca91a8-6313-4db1-82fd-325f1dc1f320" class="">It was difficult to maintain the balance between keeping a target user interested in the story you were telling while also keeping it at a place where those we might have accidentally happened upon your story could still find threads of logic that resonated with them and left them feeling more informed in their positions on conservation funding.</p>

<h3 id="560b85c1-e5db-4bcb-9d27-2762b0854a26" class="">What I Learned Along The Way</h3>

<p>This class really helped me gain a better understanding  of nuanced design concepts, applying frameworks to the critique of design, and how to build out a portfolio.</p>

<p>The portfolio piece is one that I have especially enjoyed as I have wanted to setup a personal website for a longtime and this courses content both motivated me to do that and learn more about what I needed to do that.</p>

<p>For the final project, it was fun to dive deeper into a topic I had been curious about and work with how you can tell a story with datasets associated with the story you want to tell. I also found the processes illuminating on how many different stories could be told with the same data or even the same charts. This gave me a greater appreciation for how complicated it can be to bring together and unite disparate stakeholders around a single policy proposal.</p>
