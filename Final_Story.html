<p id="72c1d32f-e7a5-4215-bada-f262ee8fbcc4" class="">I grew up in Morningside Heights, NYC and much of my early exposure to nature beyond the concrete jungle came from regular visits to the Museum of Natural History which was just a few blocks from my Elementary school P.S. 87. As a kid, this was place of wonder and magic, with marble halls housing full size dinosaur skeletons, blue whales and giant squids, and seemingly all the animals that have ever walked the earth.</p>

<p id="d1dc4d63-efbe-44a3-8542-4dee4b86ca89" class="">One of these animals that I always recall marveling at is the Tasmanian Tiger, an animal that has been declared extinct (although some feel it might be hiding in the dense jungle forests of Tasmania). The cause of the Tasmanian Tigers extinction is an easy one to guess, humanity and our excess. We, humanity, hunted the Tasmanian Tiger to extinction so that now the only real evidence of their existence is a few grainy videos and photos, and the taxidermy examples like the one I stood across so many times.</p>

<p id="5ed617e0-2634-4417-b5a9-04d2462533a0" class="">Whats odd though is that at the front of the museum is a statue of Theodore Roosevelt, a president who loved to hunt, but also who ushered in an era of american conservation that has resulted in many species being brought back from the brink of extinction.</p>
