<section>
<p>I grew up in Morningside Heights, NYC and much of my early exposure to nature beyond the concrete jungle came from regular visits to the American Museum of Natural History which was just a few blocks from my elementary school P.S. 87. As a kid, the museum was place of wonder and magic, with marble halls housing full size dinosaur skeletons, blue whales and giant squids, and seemingly all the animals that have ever walked the earth.</p>

<p>One of these animals that I always recall marveling at is the Tasmanian Tiger, an animal that has been declared extinct (although some feel it might be hiding in the dense jungle forests of Tasmania). The cause of the Tasmanian Tigers extinction is an easy one to guess, humanity and our excess. We, humanity, hunted the Tasmanian Tiger to extinction so that now the only real evidence of their existence is a few grainy videos and photos, and the taxidermy examples like the one I stood across so many times. In looking at the Tasmanian Tiger I would often feel a sense of sadness and anger at how we drove this fascinating creature to extinction.</p>

<p>Whats odd though is that at the front of the museum is a statue of Theodore Roosevelt, a president who loved to hunt, but also who ushered in an era of american conservation that has resulted in many species being brought back from the brink of extinction. As a child, this juxtaposition between Roosevelt the Hunter, and Roosevelt the Conservationist left me confused about how one could potentially be both.</p>

<h1>Hunting as Conservation?</h1>

<p>According the National Park Service: "Theodore Roosevelt created the United States Forest Service, established 150 national forests, 51 federal bird reserves, 4 national game preserves, 5 national parks, and 18 national monuments by enabling the 1906 American Antiquities Act. He protected approximately 230 million acres of public land during his presidency."</p>

<p>While: "Building upon TR's legacy, FDR created the Civilian Conservation Corps, reorganized and expanded the National Park Service, and fostered numerous acts and legislation protecting the environment, providing a basis for future conservation."</p>

<p>These actions by Theodore Roosevelt and his presidential predecessor nephew Franklin D. Roosevelt have become known as the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation, which, is widely regarded as one of the worlds most successful systems of policies for the conversation of wildlife and the land they inhabit.</p>

<p>They viewed conservation as a way to provide positive externalities for all Americans, such as the how our forest act as natural air purifiers:</p>

<div class="epigraph">
<blockquote> <p>"A nation that destroys it soils destroys itself. Forest are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people" - FDR</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>A key component of the Model ushered in by the Roosevelts is the Pittman-Robertson Act signed into law by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Pittman-Robertson Act created a tax on hunting equipment, such as firearms and ammunition, in what is known as a 'pay-to-play' approach where the theoretical user of the resource, in this case Hunters, are the ones who pay for the maintenance and stewardship of that resource, in this case wildlife.</p>

<p>As an avid backpacker now living in Portland, OR I had no idea that this approach to taxing hunters was a primary tool in conservation for the USA until I struck up a conversation with a hunter I encountered on the trail. This hunter piqued my curiosity in how we funded conservation by making an off hand comment saying "hope you enjoy your time out here, maybe one day you guys will pay for it" to which I asked what he meant by that, and he explained how he was just making a joke about the taxes he paid on his hunting gear and explained a bit about the Pittman-Robertson act. Learning about this relationship between 'user-play' 'user-pay' as a way to make hunting a tool for conservation helped me better understand the dichotomy of Theodore Roosevelt that perplexed me as a child and also grow a greater appreciation for the complexity of how we fund conservation.</p>

<p>While the 'pay-to-play' approach has been remarkably successfully resulting in $1.1 billion in taxes revenue earmarked for wildlife conservation being distributed in 2018, it is threatened by the demise of the traditional american hunter with a consistent downward trend in the percent of the population who participate.</p>

<p>Oddly though, despite a clear trend of declining numbers in hunters, the excise tax appropriations from Pittman-Robertson have risen substantially over the past few years.</p>

<h1>Why Would This Be The Case?</h1>

<p>This rise of tax revenue from Pittman-Robertson is most likely caused by a surge in gun sales related to fears around stricter 2nd amendment regulations which we can see reflected in sales spikes after mass shootings. Based on this, it would be reasonable to assume that much of the revenue from Pittman-Robertson is coming from firearms purchased with no intent to hunt with them. For example, the purchase of an AR-15 for self-defense vs the purchase of archery equipment.</p>

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1596596698240' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Gu&#47;GunSalesVsApprops&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='GunSalesVsApprops&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Gu&#47;GunSalesVsApprops&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1596596698240');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>

<p>This relationship between weapon purchases and funding for conservation deserves more consideration as the decline of hunting and unpredictability of firearm sales, regardless of how you feel about both of them in general, make them a weak foundation for the primary source of conservation funding in the United States.</p>

<div class="epigraph">
<blockquote> <p>"Both the potential for market-based fluctuation of the excise tax structure and the public benefit nature of Pittman-Robertson have led some stakeholders to propose amending the act to include a funding source that they argue is more stable and not solely reliant on hunters and recreational
shooters." - Congressional Research</p>

  <h1>What Can You Do About It?</h1>

  <p>One potential solution would be to expand the 'pay-to-play' model by taxing those who enjoy the benefits from it today, such as hikers or birdwatchers who enjoy the use of trails paid for by hunters/gun sales, but in reality don't pay for it themselves since things like hiking boots and binoculars are not taxed the same way as hunting equipment. A bill authorizing a tax on the type of equipment sold at REI (e.g., tents, backpacks, climbing gear) as alternate funding source for Pittman-Robertson could provide additional resources for federal agencies or tribal partners to implement the conservation of threatened and endangered species.</p>

  <p>With almost 30,000 species facing extinction because of human activity and the resulting climate change we now more than ever need to revisit how we can improve our funding of conservation or face the reality that our children will perhaps look at a stuffed replica of the Red Wolf much the same way I looked at the Tasmanian Tiger and ask themselves: "How could we let this happen?".</p>
