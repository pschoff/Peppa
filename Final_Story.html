<p id="72c1d32f-e7a5-4215-bada-f262ee8fbcc4" class="">I grew up in Morningside Heights, NYC and much of my early exposure to nature beyond the concrete jungle came from regular visits to the Museum of Natural History which was just a few blocks from my Elementary school P.S. 87. As a kid, this was place of wonder and magic, with marble halls housing full size dinosaur skeletons, blue whales and giant squids, and seemingly all the animals that have ever walked the earth.</p>

<p id="d1dc4d63-efbe-44a3-8542-4dee4b86ca89" class="">One of these animals that I always recall marveling at is the Tasmanian Tiger, an animal that has been declared extinct (although some feel it might be hiding in the dense jungle forests of Tasmania). The cause of the Tasmanian Tigers extinction is an easy one to guess, humanity and our excess. We, humanity, hunted the Tasmanian Tiger to extinction so that now the only real evidence of their existence is a few grainy videos and photos, and the taxidermy examples like the one I stood across so many times.</p>

<p>Whats odd though is that at the front of the museum is a statue of Theodore Roosevelt, a president who loved to hunt, but also who ushered in an era of american conservation that has resulted in many species being brought back from the brink of extinction.</p>

<blockquote> <p>There can be nothing in the world more beautiful than the Yosemite, the groves of the giant sequoias and redwoods, the Canyon of the Colorado, the Canyon of the Yellowstone, the Three Tetons; and our people should see to it that they are preserved for their children and their children&#x27;s children forever, with their majestic beauty all unmarred. - Theodore Roosevelt </p>

<h1>Hunting as Conservation?</h1>
<p>If not for the actions of Theodore Roosevelt and his presidential predecessors</p>

<p>According the National Park Service: "Theodore Roosevelt created the United States Forest Service, established 150 national forests, 51 federal bird reserves, 4 national game preserves, 5 national parks, and 18 national monuments by enabling the 1906 American Antiquities Act. He protected approximately 230 million acres of public land during his presidency."</p>

<p>While: "Building upon TR's legacy, FDR created the Civilian Conservation Corps, reorganized and expanded the National Park Service, and fostered numerous acts and legislation protecting the environment, providing a basis for future conservation."</p>

<p>These actions by Theodore Roosevelt and his presidential predecessor nephew Franklin D. Roosevelt have become known as the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation, which, is widely regarded as one of the worlds most successful systems of policies for the conversation of wildlife and the land they inhabit.</p>

<p>They viewed conservation as a way to provide positive externalities for all Americans, such as the how our forest act as natural air purifiers:</p>

<div class="epigraph">
<blockquote> <p>"A nation that destroys it soils destroys itself. Forest are the lungs of our land, purifying the air and giving fresh strength to our people - FDR</p>
