<h1>The Sinister Source of Our Conservation Funding</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Final Project: Story Telling With Data</p>
<p class="subtitle">Peter W. Schoffelen</p>
<section>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Despite declining numbers in hunters, the excise tax appropriations from Robert-Pittman rose substantially during the Obama administration(most likely explained by gun sales driven by fear of stricter gun laws), and that the decline (less fearful of stricter gun laws) during the Trump administration makes aspect like a Backpack Tax (a tax on equipment sold from REI) possibly good solutions to sustaining conservation funding while also advancing more progressive gun control.</p>
<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>
<ul><b>Aim: </b>To have readers recognize that the funding of conservation is more complex than one might intially imagine and that if we care about conservation we must ensure its funding by diversfying the sources of tax revenue earmaked for conservation programs</ul>
<ul>
  <b>Measures of Success: </b>call to action conversion and social media shares I think would be good metrics for the success of the this story; A full suite of more in-depth analtyics, such as dwell time, would be a useful complement to the primary measures.
</ul>

<h3>Outline/Wireframe</h3>
<p>
  <b>Hook: </b>Did you know that a Tax on hunting equipment accounts for an average of <b>$713 million</b> dollars in appropriations towards conservation from 2012 to 2016 and was <b>the single largest source of federal funding for convservation</b>? The next larget source of federal fundings for conservation is less that half that amount at just $338 million per year average from 2012 to 2016 with the revenue coming from general tax revenue paid for by we the people.

<p>
  <b>Building: </b>The funding from taxing hunters is known as the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation and is widly considered one of the most succesful convervation programs in  the world, briniging many spcecies back from the brink of extiction.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Luring:</b>The money also is the primary source for much of the maitenance and managment of resources enjoyed by a large array outdoor recreation entusiats such as Birdwatchers, hikers, backpackers, and mountain bikers. But this funding appears to be at risk as the numbers hunters in the united states has been on a slow and steady decline since the the 1920s and there is no current plan to broaden the tax base beyond hunters.

Decline In Hunters Threatens How U.S. Pays For Conservation

CHART SHOWING DECLINE IN HUNTERS
</p>

<p><b>Luring/Context Switch:</b>Oddly though, despite all the doom and gloom around the decline of the americna hunter and the risk this poses for conservation, funding from the tax on hunters has risen substiatially over the last few years despite some of the steepest declines in those participating in hunting.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/20/593001800/decline-in-hunters-threatens-how-u-s-pays-for-conservation">
<b>What explains this inverse relationship between a decline in hunting but a rise in revenue from taxes on hunting despite the tax remaining unchanged since (date from mad long ago)?</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>CHART SHOWING DECLINE IN HUNTERS RELATIVE TO RISE IN FUNDING THROUGH PITTMAN </b>
</p>

<p>One possible explanation is that much of the tax revenue derived from hunting, isn't actually derieved from hunting activities but rather from the general sale of firearms and related equipment</p>

<p><b>chart showing spike in guns sales during specific periods of fear abotu policy of more restrictive gun control</b></p>

<p>chart showing % of funding that comes from hunting related activties</p>

<p>chart showing flat level in purchases of shotguns and bows relative to handguns and rifles <em>indicative of spending on non-hunting related activity as a shotgun is more used in hunting then self-defense</em></p>

<p>Maybe funny images asking the reader who do you think owns more guns and shoots more ammo? Image of traditional hunter vs prepper type militia charecter</p>

<p><b>Chart showing rise in tax alongside rise in gun sales</b></p>


<p>So, it might seem that the decline in hunting doesnt actually threaten the US model of conservation all that much, but what might pose a threat to it is more progressive gunc control, which is a real reality in a democrat/progressive lead country</p>

<p><b>American attitudes towards gun control (most support more restrivtive legislation) from pew research</b></p>
<p><b>chart showing pew research findings on american attitudes</b></p>

<p>This creates an odd paradox for the progressive agenda as generally the democratic platform is known for advocating for more conservation and enviromentally focused funding as well as stricter gun control laws.</p>

<p><b>Can I show an average NRA rating of democrats in office vs an environmental NRA that rates officials?</b></p>

<p>One way we can ensure more funding for conservation that goes towards sustaining outdoor recreation regardless of if your a hunter or a birdwatcher is by expanding the base/enlarging the pie of tax revenue captured through an expansion of the robert PITTMAN act to include equipment sold through retailers like REI, this tax is commonly called a 'Backpack' tax </p>

<p>With a backpack tax, the base of revenue could be engalrgened so that there would still be substantial funding regardless of what the country does around gun control</p>

<h3>Data Manipulation</h3>
<p>Currently, I am planning on doing my vizulizations in R as it is a tool I have used in the past but want to learn more about customizing graphs using it. I am also drawn to it as a tool since it is free and open source. The aspect of it being free makes it a more marketable skill as you don't have to ask your boss for an expensive subscription or license for a product that lets you do what you were hired to do.</p>

<h3>Presenting the Data</h3>
<p>Currently, my desire is to do my storytelling with data in my portfolio using the CSS for styling. My reasoning in this is that the CSS I use is borrowed from Edward Tufte while has a few nice features inclinded towards readability, such as the use of off white and off black to make reading on a screen easier. Also, similar to my desire to use R for generating my charts and manipulating my data, doing the final project  as a well integrated peice of my portfolio helps me build my web dev skills and not be as reliant on a paid tool when the class is over.</p>

<h2>User Research</h2>
<h3>User Personas/Target Audience</h3>
<p><b>Hunter</b></p>
<p>As a <b>Hunter</b> I want <b>to understand my contribution to conservation</b> so that I can <b>make informed choices around how I choose to support conservation</b></p>

<p><b>Outdoor Enthusiats</b></p>
<p>As a <b>Outdoor Enthusiats</b> I want <b>to understand my contribution to conservation</b> so that I can <b>make informed choices around how I choose to support conservation</b></p>

<p><b>Gun Control Advocate</b></p>

<h3>User Feedback Proccess</h3>
<p>I am somwehat familiar with getting user feedback but more from the side of building a new product or service that addresses a pain point for a target market and validating if your concept of how to resolve that pain point resonates with them (product-market fit)</p>

<p><b>Finding Users:</b> Finding users was not to tough as I have friends and co-workers who fall into the user personas I am generally looking to better understand.</p>
<p><b>Script</b>I like to generally start very open ended on my user research interactions and let thier intial responses then guide the convservation. Below is the my opening question, which I then used as a starting point for telling my story, which I did through oral narrative and showing protype charts.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Starting Question: </b>Where do you believe the majoraty of conservation funding comes from?</li>
<li><b>Ending Question: </b>Would you be open to paying more for conservation?</li>
</ul>

<p><b>User: Sam (Normal Person/Gun Control Advocate)</b></p>
<p>Feedback: </p>
<p><b>User: Justin (Hunter)</b></p>
<p><b>User: Will (Backpacker)</b></p>
