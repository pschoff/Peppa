        <p>a quick and dirty chart made using OECD data as collected here: <code>head</code> block:</p>
        <p>General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.<code>head</code> block:</p>

        <p>For my third visualization I tried a treemap as an alternative to the bar chart as a method for showing hierarchical relationships. My thought in choosing this was that in examining debt across different nation states, we probably either want to understand 1) where certain countries of interest sit relative to other countries in their debt ratio, and/or 2) a ranking of countries by their debt ratio.</p>
      <p>While a bar chart provides great visualization of ranking of countries by their debt ratio, a tree diagram lets us examine the size of debt ratios relative to each other in a unique way compared to bar charts and our spark line charts.</p>
      <p>Ideally I would have added nesting to leverage the full benefits of a treemap, By using nesting (ex: continent), we might have been able to better see debt ratios compared across country while still being able to understand debt ratio as individual countries.</p>
      <p>This understanding of debt relative to other countries provided by the treemap is also a benefit when compared to the sparklines, which do a great job of showing debt ratio trends for an individual country but do not help show debt ratio compared to other countries.</p>
